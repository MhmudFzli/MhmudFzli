- âš¡ Fun fact: human brain is much faster at determining scene novelty and has a
                much larger capacity. To achieve this, the brain uses an agreement between
                multiple neurons. The more neurons indicate that the given image is novel, the
                higher the novelty is. Thus, the brain does not need to remember full states;
                instead, it trains itself to recognise the novelty.
